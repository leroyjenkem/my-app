          SKYHÃ˜GA is brought to you by a merry group of idealists who believe
          in the right to self-determination over oppressive legislation. We
          wish to extend our personal gratitude towards anyone growing
          something besides a moustache, your efforts are the very foundation
          of our shared cause.
