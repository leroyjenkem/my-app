          We want to do our part in reducing the inherent uncertainty
          associated with darknet trading as well as to promote a safe
          marketplace by the means of establishing a peer-driven user rating
          system including both the sellers and the buyers using the service,
          aiming to make the experience as transparent as possible for all
          parties.
