          The best way to show your support is to register an account and
          start using our service. Buyer profiles are priced at 15 euros,
          payble in Bitcoin to address mentioned in the registering form.
          Seller profiles are priced at 300 euros to incentivize honest
          conduct and discourage burning accounts. All proceeds are used to
          run and develop the service, excess funds are donated yearly to the
          Finnish Cannabis Association.
